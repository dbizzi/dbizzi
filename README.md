I am actively studying and gaining practical experience in Python programming, Docker, and CI/CD practices. Here's an overview of my learning journey:

- Python Programming: I am dedicated to honing my skills in Python programming. I have a solid understanding of core concepts such as variables, data types, conditionals, loops, functions, and file handling. I am currently expanding my knowledge by exploring advanced topics like object-oriented programming (OOP) and working with external libraries.

- Docker: I am excited to delve into containerization technology using Docker. I am learning how to create, manage, and deploy containers, enabling me to develop applications that are portable, scalable, and isolated. I am studying Docker concepts, including images, containers, volumes, and networks, and actively practicing building and deploying applications using Docker.

- CI/CD: I am focusing on understanding Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD) practices. I am learning about popular CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions. I am exploring how to set up automated build processes, run tests, and deploy applications to different environments. I am also studying best practices in maintaining code quality and ensuring seamless delivery through the CI/CD pipeline.

- Hands-On Projects: I am engaging in practical projects to apply my Python, Docker, and CI/CD knowledge. By building real-world applications, I am gaining hands-on experience in developing Python-based projects, containerizing them with Docker, and integrating CI/CD pipelines for efficient development and deployment workflows.

- Ongoing Learning: I am committed to continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest trends and advancements in Python, Docker, and CI/CD. I invest time in online courses, tutorials, and blogs to expand my knowledge and ensure that my skills align with current industry standards.
